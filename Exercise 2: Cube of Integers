#### Compute for the cube of integers. 

# Input the size of the array.
size = int(input("Enter the size of the array: "))

# Input the elements of the array separated by space and convert them to a list of integers.
elements = list(map(int, input("Enter the elements separated by space: ").split()))

# Iterate through each element in the list and print its cube.
for element in elements:
    print(element ** 3)
