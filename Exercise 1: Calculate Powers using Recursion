#### A teacher named Mrs. Rivera who loved making math fun for her students. One day, a student named Mia asked how to calculate powers, like (2^7). Mrs. Rivera explained, “Imagine you need to multiply 2 by itself seven times. We can solve this using a python code utilizing  special method called recursion to solve this,” 
#### Can you help the class of Mrs. Rivera by providing the recursive method to calculate powers?

# Define the base number.
base = 2

# Define the exponent.
exponent = 7

# Recursive function to calculate power.
def recursive_power(base, exponent):
    # Base case: if the exponent is 0, return 1.
    if exponent == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        # Recursive case: multiply the base by the result of the function with the exponent decreased by 1.
        return base * recursive_power(base, exponent - 1)

# Calculate the result using the recursive function.
result = recursive_power(base, exponent)

# Print the result.
print(result)
